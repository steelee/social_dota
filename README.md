# EC2 Mobile <img align="right" src="aws.png"/>
An app written using React-Native for managing EC2 instances from your mobile device.

Launch new instances, suspend existing ones, and more once this nonsens is figured out

## Running
You'll need react-native installed:
`sudo npm install react-native --global`

Refer to [getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) if you're new to react native. Then
just run `react-native start` to deploy.

Not sure yet on how to handle authentication, but you'll likely want to provide your own AWS user credientials. Learn more about that [here]()
